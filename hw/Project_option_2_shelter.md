I found a kaggle dataset on shelter animal outcomes.
The goal is to predict the outcome of the animal such as adoption, return to owner, etc.
I would have several variables available to predict the outcome, such as animal age, color, breed, etc.
The dataset has about 26k records, and 5 possible outcomes.
I chose this dataset because I adopted my dog from a shelter, and I am interested in this topic.
