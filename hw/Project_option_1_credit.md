I found a previous Kaggle competition for credit data.
The goal is to predict the probability of default given several variables such as Income,
utilization, age, etc.

The dataset has about 150k records, with about 10k people with a delinqency.

I chose this topic because I work in the credit industry, and it would be applicable to my job.
